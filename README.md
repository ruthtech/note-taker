# Note Taker
 This application enables the user to write, save, and delete notes on a to-do list.

## Getting Started
All of the files can be loaded with your browser. Copy the files to your local directory, open a Git Terminal and type "node server.js". Then open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000.

### Prerequisites
A browser. Chrome was used for testing. 

### Installing
    1. Go to https://github.com/ruthtech/note-taker and click on the "Clone or Download" button. 
    2. Choose "Download ZIP". 
    3. Unzip into a directory. If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and navigate to the download directory. Select the ZIP file, right click, and choose "Extract All". Accept the default location.
    4. Once the file is unzipped, navigate to note-taker-master and use your browser to open index.html.
    5. Install the prerequisites through your Git Terminal:
          * express (type npm install express)
          * JEST (type npm install jest)


## Running the tests
Type "npm test" in your Git terminal to run the automated test suite. 

### Manual tests (for the UI)
First start the server via your Git terminal:
    1. node server.js

Then open a browser on "localhost:3000":
    1. User opens the note taker and looks at the notes that already exist.
    2. User adds a note.
    3. User deletes a note.


## Deployment
Because this application requires a live server, there is no live demo at this time. Copy the files to your computer, start the server, and view localhost:3000.
